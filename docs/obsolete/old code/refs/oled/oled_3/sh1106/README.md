sh1106
======

An Arduino library for the SH1106 LCD chipset

Features:
	text display with scrolling
	pixel drawing
	rectangles, outline, filled
	lines, any angle

I have run this with an SSD1306 based display also without any issues.  It doesn't take advantage of any advanced features of the chip but works as expected.

I have a beaglebone black version available if anyone is interested.  Send me a note and I can make it available.
